## Overview
This project examines the economic impact of Lionel Messi’s arrival at Inter Miami, focusing on ticket price dynamics and revenue implications. By applying regression analysis, we quantify the superstar effect on ticket pricing and estimate its influence on Inter Miami's annual revenue.

## Key Findings
Messi’s debut led to a dramatic increase in ticket prices, with some games experiencing over a **1,000% price surge**.
Using **multiple linear regression models**, we estimate that Messi's presence initially led to a **$40.9 million** annual revenue boost, well above his **$20.4 million** salary.
However, accounting for time trends, the long-term revenue effect decreases to **$8.4 million**, suggesting a potential demand stabilization.
Messi's impact extends beyond ticket sales, influencing **merchandise, sponsorships, and global visibility** for Inter Miami and MLS.
Methodology
The analysis utilizes ticket sales data from **SeatData.io**, covering Inter Miami matches from **2021 to 2024**. Key variables include:
- **Ticket price trends** before and after Messi’s arrival.
- **Seating categories, home vs. away games, and opponent strength**.
- **Multiple linear regression** models incorporating interaction terms to capture Messi’s effect.
